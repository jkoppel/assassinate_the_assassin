What is this
============

This is a 3D turn-based tactical first-person sworder, written in 2007 (age 15) for a competition to create a Facebook app promoting the game Assassin's Creed, although it's barely tied to the Facebook platform. Two players move around a 15x15 grid, using various weapons to corner and assassinate their opponent. The game is described in more detail in the design document and the manual.

I mostly wrote this in a single all-nighter, perhaps my most productive day of the last five years. This is also some of the worst code I've written in the last five years; at the time, I had not written any PHP since 2005. It's almost entirely contained in index.php, which is actually three-quarters JavaScript.
