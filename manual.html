<pre>Very quick and hasty manual - full version coming.

The game is turn based.

The object is to kill your opponent.

You get 8 actions per turn.

Each ability costs a different amount of actions; you can't do that if you don't have enough.

You can move and turn; diagonally moving does not same actions or let you cut corners,
just saves real life time.

Cloak makes you invisible to your opponent. Anything except moving and turning decloaks you.

There are two weapons so far: Sword and Dagger.

You cannot cloak while wielding the sword.

The sword slash kills from two spaces away (not through walls), but if your opponent
is wielding a sword and you're not behind him/her, s/he will parry.

The dagger backstab kill only from behind your opponent (not through walls), if you are facing them.

(Use the minimap to decide if you're facing someone - a 45 degree angle is still facing them even if you can't see them.)

You can set one stun bomb; setting another will destroy the first. You can trigger your own stun bombs.
Detonating stun bomb will set your actions to -16. You can lay a stun bomb through walls.

If your opponent is hiding from you, you can spend two consecutive turns preparing and using the Amulet of Detect Life,
which tells you where your opponent is.
